# CTF Writeups

A repository to collect my writeups and notes on CTF challenges I did.


https://sirius-a.github.io/ctf-writeups/


## Getting Started

The page is rendered via [mkdocs-material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material)
using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as the python package manager.

``` sh
git clone git@github.com:Sirius-A/ctf-writeups.git

cd ctf-writeups

# Insatall Deps
poetry install

# Serve the page locally
poetry run mkdocs serve

# Build a static HTML site
poetry run mkdocs build --strict
```
